                Here's a collection of formal works I've written over the years. 

                <h4>
                    Mitra Family Humanities Research (April '20 â€” May '21)

                    The John Near and Mitra Family Humanities Research program is a selection-based humanities research program at The Harker School.
                    I researched the role of fire in indigenous-European relations and settlement in Australia for a little over a year. The process
                    culminated in a 30-page paper that was published in the Harker School's journal, and I presented the work at
                    the end of year conference featuring faculty, students, and administration.
