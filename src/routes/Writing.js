            Here's a collection of works I've written over the years. Since most of my writing is in the form of academic essays
            written for class, locked away in Google Drive folders, I figured I'd showcase some of them here on this website. 
            
            <h4>
                Mitra Family Humanities Research (April '20 â€” May '21) 
            </h4>

            <p>
                The John Near and Mitra Family Humanities Research program is a selection-based humanities research program at The Harker School.
                I researched the role of fire in indigenous-European relations and settlement in Australia for a little over a year. The process
                culminated in a 30-page paper that was published in the Harker School's journal, and I presented the work at 
                the end of year conference featuring faculty, students, and administration.

            <h4>
                Irish Identity and Intellectualism: Surveying James Joyce (May '21) 
            </h4>

            <p>
                I researched some of James Joyce's work, primarily focusing on <i>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i>, and the influence of Ireland's
                historical context in the works' themes. 
            </p>
